# GrooveGrow
This rhythm-based party game blends musical skill with physical movement challenges. 

## **Core Concept**

Each run (or round) of the game becomes a challenge where the first player plays a rhythm (from the cards they have drawn), and subsequent players must either:

- **Replicate and Expand:** Successfully replicate the previous player's sequence and add an additional rhythmic element from one of their cards, or
- **Play a More Complicated Variation:** Introduce a new, more complex variation from their hand, surpassing the previous rhythm in overall complexity.

This creates a cumulative sequence that not only tests memory but also rewards creative and technical skill.

## Rules & Structure

### **Card Decks**

see Groove Grow - Prototype Card Decks.pdf

- **Rhythm Cards**
    - rhythm patterns of one measure with complexity level ranging from 1-5
- **Instrument Cards**
    - tools to play the rhythm including
        - human body parts. e.g., voice, finger, foot, head, etc.
        - or a random object that is accessible to the player. e.g., one thing in your pocket, pen, book etc.
- **Fun Modifier Cards**
    - Cards that can modify the setup, make it either more difficult or easier!
    - e.g., swap one rhythm cards from the last person, complexity plus 1, increase the bpm by 5, decrease the bpm by 10, beats change up, revival (add 1 HP), etc.

### Setup and Card Draw

- **HP distribution**
    - each player has 5 HP initially
- **Initial Card Draw:**
    - At the start of each round, each player draws 4 or more cards (according to the number of players and their musical training level) from a combined deck of Rhythm Cards.
- **Starting the Run:**
    - One player (determined by a random selection or a tournament-style order) begins the run by selecting at one Rhythm card. They need to draw a Instrument Card and play the corresponding rhythm using the body part or the objects.

### Building on the Rhythm

- **Player Turn Requirements:**
    - The next player will first draw a Fun Modifier Card, and a Instrument Card.
    - They have to use the Fun Modifier Card!
    - The they must **choose one** of two strategies for their turn:
        1. **Replication Plus Addition:**
            - **Step 1:** Accurately replicate the entire sequence created by the previous player(s).
            - **Step 2:** Add one extra rhythmic element from one of their drawn cards.
        2. **Introduce a More Complex Variation:**
            - Present a rhythm that is more complex than the previous one and replace the  Rhythm Card from the previous player.

### Challenges and Scoring

- **Judging the Performance:**
    - **Peer or Designated Judge:** Other players (or an appointed judge) evaluate whether the rhythm was replicated accurately and if the added element is valid according to the challenge.
    - **Criteria:**
        - **Accuracy:** Did the player fully replicate the previous sequence?
        - **Creativity & Complexity:** Was the added element sufficiently challenging or creative?
        - **Consistency with Rules:** Were the correct body parts/movements used as indicated on the card(s)?
- **Scoring Mechanisms:**
    - Once the player performs, the others evaluate the accuracy based on pre-determined criteria (timing, proper sequence, correct use of instrument or body part, etc.).
    - If the majority agree the performance was off, that player loses 1 HP.

### Game Flow and Winning Condition

- **Cumulative Run:**
    - With each player’s turn, the sequence grows. The challenge increases as players must play longer sequences and complex rhythmic variations.
- **Elimination and Game End**
    - A player with 0 HP is **out of the current round**.
    - The game can continue until a set number of rounds are played, or until one player remains.
    - there might be “revival” modifier cards or bonus challenges that allow a player to regain HP to keep the game exciting.
    - **In Team Mode:** For cooperative or team-based play, aggregate HP across teams to build a shared defensive strategy against errors.
 
### **Dynamics**

The mechanics create an evolving challenge as players progressively build and modify a rhythmic sequence. Each player will adapt and creatively expand on the previous performance. Modifier Cards introduce unexpected changes and fun, encouraging spontaneous strategy and decision-making, while the HP system injects tension and urgency into every turn.

### Aesthetics

The game evokes an interactive, energetic and immersive atmosphere that can at the same time train players rhythmic skills and their motor system.
